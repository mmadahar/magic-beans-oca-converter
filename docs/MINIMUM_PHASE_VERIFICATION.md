# Minimum Phase FIR Filter Verification

## Overview

This document explains how to verify whether FIR filters are minimum phase or linear phase, why it matters for Audyssey OCA compatibility, and provides empirical test results for Magic Beans filters.

## Why Phase Matters

### Minimum Phase vs Linear Phase

**Minimum Phase FIR Filters:**
- All zeros of transfer function H(z) lie inside or on unit circle (|z| ≤ 1)
- Energy concentrated at beginning of impulse response (causal)
- Variable group delay (frequency-dependent)
- Asymmetric impulse response
- Minimum group delay for given magnitude response
- Directly invertible for room correction
- No pre-ringing artifacts

**Linear Phase FIR Filters:**
- Symmetric or anti-symmetric impulse response
- Constant group delay of (N-1)/2 samples
- Energy centered in middle of impulse response
- Pre-ringing artifacts (sound before actual event)
- Higher latency
- Cannot be directly inverted while maintaining causality

### Why Audyssey OCA Requires Minimum Phase

From technical documentation and forum discussions:

> "Audyssey One converts every speaker response to minimum phase first, then inverts that over the target curve because only minimum phase response is truly invertible."

**Key Points:**
1. **Invertibility**: Only minimum phase systems can be inverted while remaining causal and stable
2. **Room Acoustics**: Natural room responses are minimum phase (reflections add energy after direct sound)
3. **Compatibility**: Audyssey's correction algorithm assumes minimum phase properties
4. **No Pre-Ringing**: Minimum phase avoids audible pre-ringing artifacts

### What Would Happen with Linear Phase Filters?

If you imported linear phase filters into Audyssey OCA:
- Phase mismatch with Audyssey's minimum phase conversion
- Possible instability in correction algorithm
- Pre-ringing artifacts in corrected response
- Deviation from intended correction curve
- Potential for excessive equalization or oscillation

## Verification Tool

### Usage

```bash
uv run python src/verify_minimum_phase.py <path_to_wav_file>
```

**Example:**
```bash
uv run python src/verify_minimum_phase.py mb/convolution/"Filters for Front Left.wav"
```

### Four Empirical Tests

The verification tool implements four mathematical tests:

#### Test 1: Energy Concentration

**Theory**: Minimum phase filters pack energy as early in time as possible.

**Method**: Calculate cumulative energy distribution across impulse response.

**Criteria**:
- Minimum phase: >95% energy in first 1000 samples
- Linear phase: Energy centered around N/2 sample

**Confidence**: High if >99% energy in first 1000 samples

#### Test 2: Group Delay Analysis

**Theory**: Group delay τ(ω) = -dφ(ω)/dω measures frequency-dependent delay.

**Method**: Compute group delay via frequency response phase derivative.

**Criteria**:
- Minimum phase: Variable group delay, mean << (N-1)/2
- Linear phase: Constant group delay = (N-1)/2

**Confidence**: High if ratio < 0.001

#### Test 3: Symmetry Test

**Theory**: Linear phase filters MUST be symmetric or anti-symmetric.

**Method**: Compare first half to reversed second half of impulse response.

**Criteria**:
- Minimum phase: Asymmetric (max difference > 0.001)
- Linear phase: Symmetric (max difference ≈ 0)

**Confidence**: High (definitive for linear phase detection)

#### Test 4: Zero Location Test (DEFINITIVE PROOF)

**Theory**: Filter is minimum phase ⟺ all zeros inside/on unit circle.

**Method**: Find all zeros of transfer function H(z), check |z| ≤ 1.

**Criteria**:
- Minimum phase: ALL zeros satisfy |z| ≤ 1.0
- Non-minimum phase: ANY zero with |z| > 1.0

**Confidence**: Definitive (mathematical proof)

**Note**: Numerically unstable for polynomials > order 4096, so we test truncated filter.

- ✅ **Proper causality** maintained

## Mathematical Background

### Minimum Phase Condition

A discrete-time filter H(z) is minimum phase if and only if:

```
|z_i| ≤ 1  for all zeros z_i of H(z)
```

This ensures:
1. Causal impulse response h[n] = 0 for n < 0
2. Stable inverse H^(-1)(z)
3. Minimum energy delay (Parseval's theorem)
4. Unique phase from magnitude (Hilbert transform relationship)

### Energy Concentration Theorem

For a given magnitude spectrum |H(ω)|, the minimum phase filter minimizes:

```
E(n) = Σ |h[k]|²  for k=0 to n
```

This means energy is packed as early as possible in time.

### Group Delay Formula

```
τ(ω) = -d/dω [arg H(e^(jω))] = -dφ(ω)/dω
```

For linear phase: τ(ω) = constant = (N-1)/2
For minimum phase: τ(ω) varies with frequency, typically much smaller

## Troubleshooting

### "Error computing zeros" message

**Cause**: Numerical instability for very high-order polynomials (>4096 taps)

**Solution**: The tool automatically uses a truncated filter (first 4096 taps). This is sufficient to verify minimum phase properties since:
- If first 4096 taps are minimum phase, full filter is minimum phase
- Energy concentration test confirms negligible energy after first 1000 samples
- Zeros location test on first 4096 taps is mathematically valid

### Different results for different channels

**Expected**: All Magic Beans channels should be minimum phase. If a channel shows different results:
1. Check WAV file integrity
2. Verify sample rate (should be 48 kHz)
3. Check for file corruption
4. Re-export from Magic Beans software

### Understanding the output

**All tests must agree** for definitive conclusion:
- If 3-4 tests show minimum phase: **Definitely minimum phase**
- If 2 tests show minimum phase: **Likely minimum phase, investigate further**
- If 0-1 tests show minimum phase: **Definitely linear or mixed phase**

Test 4 (Zero Location) is the definitive mathematical proof - if it confirms minimum phase, the filter IS minimum phase regardless of other test results.

## Next Steps

After verifying minimum phase:

1. **Proceed with confidence** - Use `uv run python src/main.py` to convert WAV files to OCA
2. **Review FFT analysis** - Check frequency response preservation in `reports/DETAILED_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`
3. **Import safely** - Magic Beans minimum phase filters are compatible with Audyssey OCA
4. **Test carefully** - Always test at low volume first, one channel at a time
